#+TITLE: exlybar

Exlybar is an “Emacs Polybar like thing”.

It aims to act as an X window manager agnostic status bar and system tray that
is written completely in elisp and fully configurable in Emacs.

The most apparent usage scenario at present is to pair it with [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][Exwm]].

It is currently pre version 1.0 and the API is not yet stable.

Like Exwm, it relies on xcb via xelb to communicate with an Xorg server.

Current version: *0.21.3*

Note: *This probably doesn’t work well with multiple screens at the moment.*

* Synopsis of work in progress
** Now supported
+ Display at the top of the screen as window a dock window

+ Configurable horizontal module layout support left, center, right align

+ [[https://stumpwm.github.io/][Stumpwm]] like format/color code syntax for arranging module text, icon, and
  widget display

+ Rendering of TTF vector text and icon fonts via [[https://github.com/jollm/fontsloth][fontsloth]]

+ Mix fonts and conditionally change fonts within modules

+ Configurable zone colors to change icon or color text based on status

+ Module development API exists but is not yet finalized or particularly well
  documented

* Not currently supported (but planned)
+ Configuration for multiple screens/randr (this is the first priority at
  present)
+ Dock somewhere other than the screen top (this should be trivial to implement
  but is as yet untested)
+ Optionally act as the system tray (this is the second highest priority)
+ Multiple bars and gaps like in Polybar
+ Configurable transparency
+ Animations

* Project organization
Exlybar consists of five primary components:
+ Status bar xcb lifecycle, refresh, and event handling
  Entry point: file:exlybar.el

  This delegates to file:exlybar-layout.el to decide which window areas to
  copy/clear during a refresh cycle.

  This provides two autoloaded interactive functions:
  + ~(exlybar)~: display the status bar

  + ~(exlybar-exit)~: exit the status bar

+ Logical layout helpers
  Entry point: file:exlybar-layout.el

  Currently this produces horizontal layouts supporting combination of left,
  right, and center alignments of modules. It supports x and y coordinate
  offsets.

  The extents fns ~exlybar-layout-extents~ and
  ~exlybar-layout-subtract-extents~ allow for selective display update when the
  layout changes.

+ Port of Stumpwm like color command syntax
  Entry point: file:exlybar-color.el

  These are stumpwm style color/font codes meaning that each module can have a
  format string to arrange its text/icon and allow control of fonts and colors
  for individual parts or segments.

  Not yet all the stumpwm commands have been implemented.

  Currently the following color code commands are supported:
  - :font, shorthand ^f[0-9]
    ~exlybar-font-map~ is customizable and maps 0-9 to font paths
  - :fg, shorthand ^[0-9]~?  ~exlybar-color-map-fg~ is customizable and maps
    0-9 to xcb colors The optional ~ suffix (not in stumpwm) indicates to apply
    the color locally, meaning only to non color commands preceding the next
    color command if any. This is implemented as an implicit :push :pop around
    applicable segments.
  - :push, shorthand ^[
    push the current fg and font onto the stack
  - :pop, shorthand ^]
    pop the stack and restore the previous fg and font
  - ^; (not in stumpwm) acts as a noop to separate non color command
    segments. it’s mostly useful in combination with ~ operator described above

+ Base module API

  *not yet finalized*

  Entry points:
  + file:exlybar-module-types.el
  + file:exlybar-module.el

  At present it consists of a based cl-struct type ~exlybar-module~ and a set
  of generic functions and default primary methods for dispatch on objects of
  that type.

  Generic functions (default primary method descriptions):
  + ~(exlybar-module-init (m exlybar-module))~: gives an xcb pixmap, graphics
    context, a glyphset, a cache, and fills a rectangle with the background
    color.

  + ~(exlybar-module-layout-text (m exlybar-module))~: relies on
    ~fontsloth-layout~ and ~exlybar-color~ to produce a sequence of color
    commands and glyph positions

  + ~(exlybar-module-refresh (m exlybar-module))~: if the module requests a
    refresh, draw the text using glyph positions and color commands

  + ~(exlybar-module-exit (m exlybar-module))~: free xcb assets and clear
    module state

  Module implementations can provide specific :before and/or :after methods of
  the above as well as overrides to hook into the module
  init/layout/refresh/exit cycle. These should also allow module devs to
  provide module specific Emacs hooks.

+ Glyph rendering, loading, and compositing
  Entry point: file:exlybar-render.el

  This is used by exlybar-module.el to draw text. It relies on [[https://github.com/jollm/fontsloth][fontsloth]] for
  glyph rasterization and provides an implementation of glyph stream like
  functionality that is normally in xcb-render-util but is not included in xelb
  in order to support CompositeGlyphs32 requests for loaded glyphs.

* Usage caveats
*This probably doesn’t work well with multiple screens at the moment.* I only
have a laptop and no extra monitors. I plan to get a multiscreen setup for
testing soon.

It depends on fontsloth which is another project in very early stages; see the
fontsloth README linked above for a list of tested fonts.

*The module and layout APIs are not yet finalized as such configuration
procedures and customization options may change prior to a 1.0 release.*

* Installation
This project depends on [[https://github.com/jollm/fontsloth][fontsloth]], which is also not yet in MELPA, so you’ll
have to install that first if you want to try this.

Pending upload to MELPA, add this directory and file:modules/ to your emacs
load path and ~(require 'exlybar)~. Also require any desired module features
from modules/. Also see the use-package example below.

Emacs and Exwm as well as [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][Exwm]] itself along with numerous others whom I will
attempt to list as the project develops further.  See also attributions for

I’m currently poselyqualityles on librera chat. Feel free to interact as I’d
like this to be as broadly useful and fun as possible given the current scope
and limitations.
